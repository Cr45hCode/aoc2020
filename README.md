# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges.

## Setup

### Reader

You need to store your sessionId (found in the session cookie on adventofcode.com when logged in) in the config.json,
for the reader to fetch your input.
Or copy it by yourself and paste it in `inputs/[DAY].txt`,
where `[DAY]` is the day of the input you are copying in the format `DD`.
E.g.: `inputs/01.txt` if you copied the input for the day 1 challenge.

### Set day

To test a specific day, just set the `DAY` constant in the `index.js` to one of the values of the `days` constant.

### Run

Just type `npm start` to run the code for the set day.
